📈 Results and Insights
Model	Train RMSE	Test RMSE
0 ARIMA	30307.257416	25187.767836
1 ETS	31772.046436	24549.700275
📈 Model Results & 4-Month Forecast
Model Selection:
Based on the evaluation of forecasting models, ARIMA was chosen because it achieved a slightly lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) compared to the ETS model, indicating a better fit to the test data.

4-Month Sales Forecast:

Month	Forecasted Sales
2024-01-01	114,233
2024-02-01	112,433
2024-03-01	111,662
2024-04-01	111,332
Business Implications:

Inventory Management: Adjust orders to prevent overstocking while aligning with the forecasted stable trend.
Resource Optimization: Reallocate staffing, production, and logistics according to projected sales.
Sales & Marketing: Refine strategies to address forecasted demand and explore opportunities to stimulate sales.
Financial Planning: Integrate the forecast into revenue projections and budgeting for improved accuracy.
Insight: The forecast indicates a slight, steady decline in sales over the next four months. Leveraging this forecast allows informed decision-making, proactive planning, and continuous adaptation to market trends to maximize profitability.
